 - Group9_Project2023 -> solution MATLAB files divided in folders for each exercise


## Overview  
This project analyzes hourly bicycle rental data from the Seoul Bike Sharing System using MATLAB. The objective is to explore seasonal trends, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression modeling.  

## Submission Guidelines  
📌 **File Format**: Submit only MATLAB `.m` files in a compressed folder.  
📌 **Naming Convention**: Follow the required script and function names (e.g., `Group10Exe5Prog1.m`).  
📌 **Language**: Explanations must be in English or Greeklish.  
📌 **Plagiarism Warning**: Similar projects will receive the same grade.  
📌 **Presentation**: Some teams may be asked to present their results via Zoom.  

## Tasks  

### 1️⃣ Probability Distribution Analysis  
- Identify the best-fitting probability distribution for bike rentals across different seasons.  
- Use the **Chi-squared goodness-of-fit test** to compare distributions.  

### 2️⃣ Distribution Comparison Across Seasons  
- Sample **100 observations per season** and test for differences using the **Chi-squared test**.  
- Repeat the test for all seasonal pairs.  

### 3️⃣ Hourly Rental Comparison  
- Compare the **mean rentals** at different hours **within the same season** using hypothesis testing.  
- Visualize results in a **colormap**.  

### 4️⃣ Seasonal Comparison at Specific Hours  
- Use **bootstrap confidence intervals** to analyze differences in **median rentals** between two seasons per hour.  

### 5️⃣ Correlation Between Rentals and Temperature  
- Compute **Pearson correlation coefficients** to study the relationship between temperature and bike rentals.  
- Perform the analysis **per season and per hour**.  

### 6️⃣ Mutual Information Analysis  
- Evaluate **linear and non-linear dependencies** using **Mutual Information** and **Gaussianized Maximal Information Coefficient (GMIC)**.  

### 7️⃣ Regression Modeling  
- Develop a **regression model** to predict bike rentals based on temperature and possibly other weather conditions.  

## Key Methods & Techniques  
✔ **Chi-squared test** for distribution fitting and comparison  
✔ **Statistical hypothesis testing** for mean comparisons  
✔ **Bootstrap confidence intervals** for median analysis  
✔ **Pearson correlation & significance tests**  
✔ **Mutual Information & GMIC** for non-linear dependencies  
✔ **Regression analysis** for bike rental prediction  

## Expected Outcome  
📊 This project will reveal how factors like **seasons, temperature, and time of day** influence bicycle rentals in Seoul.  
📈 The results will be visualized using MATLAB through **colormaps, histograms, scatter plots, and regression models**.
