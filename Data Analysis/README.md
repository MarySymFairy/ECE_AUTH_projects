## Overview  
This project analyzes hourly bicycle rental data from the Seoul Bike Sharing System using MATLAB. The objective is to explore seasonal trends, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and regression modeling.  


## Tasks  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Probability Distribution Analysis  
- Identify the best-fitting probability distribution for bike rentals across different seasons.  
- Use the **Chi-squared goodness-of-fit test** to compare distributions.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Distribution Comparison Across Seasons  
- Sample **100 observations per season** and test for differences using the **Chi-squared test**.  
- Repeat the test for all seasonal pairs.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Hourly Rental Comparison  
- Compare the **mean rentals** at different hours **within the same season** using hypothesis testing.  
- Visualize results in a **colormap**.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Seasonal Comparison at Specific Hours  
- Use **bootstrap confidence intervals** to analyze differences in **median rentals** between two seasons per hour.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Correlation Between Rentals and Temperature  
- Compute **Pearson correlation coefficients** to study the relationship between temperature and bike rentals.  
- Perform the analysis **per season and per hour**.  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Mutual Information Analysis  
- Evaluate **linear and non-linear dependencies** using **Mutual Information** and **Gaussianized Maximal Information Coefficient (GMIC)**.  

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Regression Modeling  
- Develop a **regression model** to predict bike rentals based on temperature and possibly other weather conditions.  

## Key Methods & Techniques  
‚úî **Chi-squared test** for distribution fitting and comparison  
‚úî **Statistical hypothesis testing** for mean comparisons  
‚úî **Bootstrap confidence intervals** for median analysis  
‚úî **Pearson correlation & significance tests**  
‚úî **Mutual Information & GMIC** for non-linear dependencies  
‚úî **Regression analysis** for bike rental prediction  

## Expected Outcome  
üìä This project will reveal how factors like **seasons, temperature, and time of day** influence bicycle rentals in Seoul.  
üìà The results will be visualized using MATLAB through **colormaps, histograms, scatter plots, and regression models**.
